# audiobook
This project is an audiobook web player built with HTML, CSS, and JS. It is pretty simple, designed to help beginner developers understand the concepts of front-end web development.


For additional features, consider:
- Implementing a timeline or progress bar for better user navigation.
- Adding a random play option to enhance the user experience.
